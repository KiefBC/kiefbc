# Take Off Szn! 🚀

I'm Kiefer, a passionate developer based in beautiful British Columbia, Canada. 🌲

I love diving into new languages and technologies, particularly fascinated by 🌐 **AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks** 🧠. My continuous journey in tech has allowed me to learn various languages and frameworks:

- 🛠️ **Languages:** Rust, Swift, TypeScript, C++, Ruby, Python
- 📚 **Frameworks:** Svelte, Leptos, React, Tauri, Ruby on Rails
- 💾 **Databases:** MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- ☁️ **Platforms & Tools:** AWS, CLI mastery on POSIX systems (Linux/macOS), and Windows
- ✏️ **Favorite Editor:** Neovim (btw!)

I regularly build, and I'm increasingly drawn to creating intuitive apps. I'm always on the lookout for new frameworks, tools, and challenges to enhance my skillset and stay at the forefront of this ever-evolving field.
