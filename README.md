# Take Off Szn! 🚀

I'm Kiefer, a passionate developer based in beautiful British Columbia, Canada. 🌲

I love diving into new languages and technologies, particularly fascinated by **AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks**.

- **Languages:** Rust, Swift, C, Go
- **Frameworks:** Svelte, Leptos, Tauri
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- ✏️ **Favorite Editor:** Neovim (btw!)

I regularly build and practice, and I'm increasingly drawn to creating. All my projects are written with guidance on efficiency by AI Code Reviews.
