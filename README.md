# Take Off Szn! 🚀

I'm Kiefer, a passionate developer based in beautiful British Columbia, Canada. 🌲

I love diving into new languages and technologies, particularly fascinated by **AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks**.

- **Languages:** Rust, Swift, C, Go
- **Frameworks:** Svelte, Leptos, Tauri
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- ✏️ **Favorite Editor:** Neovim (btw!)

I regularly build and practice, and I'm increasingly drawn to creating. All my projects are written with guidance on efficiency by AI Code Reviews.

All projects are mirrored from my personal Git Server, so while It may show I have long spurts of no activity, be sure that I am still working and building.
