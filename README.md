# Hello World! 🚀

I'm Kiefer, a passionate developer based in beautiful British Columbia, Canada. 🌲

I love diving into new languages and technologies, particularly fascinated by 🌐 **AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks** 🧠. My continuous journey in tech has allowed me to master various languages and frameworks:

- 🛠️ **Languages:** Rust, Swift, TypeScript, C#, C++, Ruby
- 📚 **Frameworks:** Svelte, Leptos, React, Tauri, Ruby on Rails
- 💾 **Databases:** MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- ☁️ **Platforms & Tools:** AWS, CLI mastery on POSIX systems (Linux/macOS), and Windows
- ✏️ **Favorite Editor:** Neovim (btw!)

I regularly build engaging websites, sleek desktop applications, and I'm increasingly drawn to creating intuitive apps. 📱💻 I'm always on the lookout for new frameworks, tools, and challenges to enhance my skillset and stay at the forefront of this ever-evolving field. 🌟

Feel free to reach out—I'm always excited to connect!
