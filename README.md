# Hi there! ðŸ¤“

Hello, my name is Kiefer. I am from British Columbia, Canada. I am currently enrolled in **Camosun College**'s *Information & Computer System Program* (**ICS**).

I have interest in AI, Machine Learning/Deep Learning and a passion for learning new Languages and Technologies. I am learning to enjoy Web Design.

I am a full-time Student but make time to build applications in my free time to solidify my skills. I have found myself enjoying Rust and a bit of GUI App development.
