# Take Off Szn! 🚀

I'm Kiefer, a passionate developer based in beautiful British Columbia, Canada. 🌲

I love diving into new languages and technologies, particularly fascinated by **AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks**. My personal language(s) of choice is **Rust** followed by **Go**. 

- **Languages:** Rust, Swift, C, Go
- **Frameworks:** Svelte, Leptos, Tauri
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- ✏️ **Favorite Editor:** Neovim (btw!)

I regularly build and practice, and I'm increasingly drawn to creating. All my projects are written with guidance on efficiency by AI Code Reviews.

All projects are mirrored from my personal Git Server, so while It may show I have long spurts of no activity, be sure that I am still working and building.

The story behind my avatar is that I purchased this for $15,000 during the NFT craze and now its worth $0.30 and I use it as a daily reminder of not to get caught up in the hype and stay level headed.
